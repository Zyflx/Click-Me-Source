# Click Me

A dumb game I made about clicking a button.

You can play the game [here](https://zyflx.neocities.org).

# Running the game loacally

If you want to play the game locally, you'll need to run it from a localhost.

If you're using VS Code, you can use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Just right click on index.html in the file list on the left and click "Open with Live Server"


# Playing The Game

Clicking the "Click Me :]" button will give you one click (duh).

Once you gain a certain amount of clicks, you can upgrade you click gain to get more clicks per click.

The game will NOT save your progress when closing out or refreshing.

This is on purpose as the the game is meant to be a time waster game that you'll probably only play for one session every once in a while.
